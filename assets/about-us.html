                    <h3>Expect more than coffee.</h3>
                    <p>From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different
                        kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee but
                        also connection. We’re a neighborhood gathering place, a
                        part of your daily routine. Get to know us and you’ll
                        see: we are so much more than what we brew. We call our
                        employees partners because we are all partners in shared
                        success. We make sure everything we do is through the
                        lens of humanity—from our commitment to the
                        highest-quality coffee in the world, to the way we
                        engage with our customers and communities to do business
                        responsibly.</p>
                        <h3>OUR VALUES</h3>
                    <p>With our partners, our coffee and our customers at our core, we live these values:<br>

                        Creating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome.
                        Delivering our very best in all we do, holding ourselves accountable for results.
                        Acting with courage, challenging the status quo and finding new ways to grow our company and each other.
                        Being present, connecting with transparency, dignity and respect.
                        We are performance driven, through the lens of humanity.</p>
